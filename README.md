# ROMS
This is Dan Whitt's ROMS source code directory modified from the Rutgers-ROMS code available at myroms.org 
It contains FRONTAL ZONE and column model version of the Fox-Kemper et al. 2008 parameterization. 
WARNING: THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS - it is not designed to be used as is by others and it is certainly not a "black box".
